                        Based in Colombia, I'm a graphic design graduate who turned my enthusiasm for all things digital 
                        into a love  for web development, specializing in creating seamless experiences within
                        the React ecosystem.

                        I love working on fluid animations, engaging transitions, and complex layouts that transform
